<p>Waterskiing and wakeboarding both make use of boats to tow people at high speeds. As the names imply, waterskiing requires riders to wear skis, while wakeboarding involves a small board (similar to snowboarding). Both activities require strength and coordination. The adept can pull off stunts and tricks while participating – jumps, flips, turns, and more. If you like water skiing, surfing or snowboarding, wakeboarding is a great summer sport that offers many different health and fitness benefits. And the best part is, you’re having so much fun out on the water that you won’t even realize that you are exercising!</p>
